            <!-- <p>Hi there! My name is Simon and I am a computer science and engineering student at LTH. 
                I know, I know, I sound like a robot already but I promise I am a real human (most of the time).
                I have always been interested in technology and the way it has the ability to shape our world and the way we live.
                As a child, I was always fascinated by video games and the way they were created, and that curiosity eventually led me to pursue a career in computer science and engineering.</p>

            <p>I am currently in my second year of studies and have had the opportunity to take a wide range of courses in 
                computer science and engineering, including programming languages such as java and R, computer systems and networking, and data structures and algorithms. 
                I have also had the opportunity to work on a number of projects, both as an individual and as part of a team, including building a simple sudoku solver and 
                creating small games using a game engine.</p>
                
            <p>In my spare time, you can catch me either coding away on my latest project or playing video games (because let's be real, they're the reason I got into this field in the first place).
                I am excited to see where my studies in computer science and engineering will take me in the future, and I am looking forward to the 
                challenges and opportunities that will come my way as I continue to grow and learn in this field.</p> -->
